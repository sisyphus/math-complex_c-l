0.03
 - If compiler is gcc-3.x.x (or earlier) "exit 0;" in the Makefile.PL.
 - Another fix to test 1 in new.t.
 - Makefile.PL now runs some compiler checks - and then takes appropriate action.
 - Add nnumflag(), set_nnum() and clear_nnum() functions. Also start using the perl
   API function looks_like_number() to detect non-numeric strings.

0.02
 - Try to detect if references to "cpow" or "catanhl" will not be resolved - and
   abort the build if this problem is found to exist. (This enables us to avoid
   some FAIL reports from cpan-testers.)
 - Rewrite tests 4 and 5 in t/overload_string.t so that they don't register a fail
   if the libc bug that thinks nan**0 is NaN (instead of the correct '1') is present.

0.01
 - First release to CPAN as a separate entity. (Formerly part of Math::Complex_C.)
